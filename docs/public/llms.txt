# Zinchy Documentation

> Official documentation for Zinchy — the self-hosted enterprise AI agent platform built on OpenClaw.

## What Zinchy Is

Zinchy is a self-hosted, multi-user platform that turns OpenClaw into a team-ready AI agent system. It adds authentication, role-based access control, agent permissions, encrypted API key storage, and a web UI on top of the OpenClaw engine. Everything runs on your own infrastructure.
