## What is Zinchy?

Zinchy is an enterprise layer on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — the open-source AI agent runtime. OpenClaw is powerful for individual users. Zinchy adds what teams need: permissions, audit trails, user management, and governance.

We believe AI agents should run on **your** servers, with **your** data, under **your** control.

## Current Status

Zinchy is in early development. The core is working — setup, authentication, provider configuration, agent chat via OpenClaw, and cryptographic audit trail. We're building the remaining enterprise features (RBAC, plugins) next.
