title: Mount Data Directories
description: How to make files available to Zinchy agents by mounting directories into the container.
---

Zinchy agents can only access files inside the `/data/` directory in the container. To make your documents available, you mount host directories into subdirectories of `/data/` using Docker volumes.

## The `/data/` convention

All agent-accessible files live under `/data/` inside the Zinchy container. This path is a Docker volume by default (`zinchy-data`), but you can bind-mount additional host directories as subdirectories.

This convention provides a clear boundary: anything under `/data/` is potentially accessible to agents (depending on their permissions), and nothing outside `/data/` is.

## Adding volumes in `docker-compose.yml`

To mount a local folder, add a bind mount under the `zinchy` service's `volumes` section:

```yaml
services:
  zinchy:
    volumes:
      - openclaw-config:/openclaw-config
      - zinchy-data:/data
      - openclaw-extensions:/openclaw-extensions
      # Add your data directories here:
      - /path/on/host/hr-policies:/data/hr-policies:ro
      - /path/on/host/engineering-docs:/data/engineering-docs:ro
```

The `:ro` suffix mounts the directory as read-only, which is recommended since agents only need to read files.

After updating `docker-compose.yml`, restart the stack:

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

## Examples

### Local folder

Mount a folder from your host machine:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /home/admin/company-docs:/data/company-docs:ro
```

### NAS or network drive

If your NAS is mounted on the host at `/mnt/nas/shared`, mount a subdirectory:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /mnt/nas/shared/legal:/data/legal:ro
  - /mnt/nas/shared/finance:/data/finance:ro
```

### Multiple directories

You can mount as many directories as you need:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /srv/docs/hr:/data/hr:ro
  - /srv/docs/engineering:/data/engineering:ro
  - /srv/docs/compliance:/data/compliance:ro
```

Each mounted directory appears as a separate selectable option in the Permissions tab when configuring an agent.

## How directories appear in the UI

When you configure an agent's permissions in the **Permissions tab** of Agent Settings, Zinchy scans `/data/` for subdirectories and displays them as selectable options. Each mounted directory shows up by name — for example, `/data/hr-policies` appears as "hr-policies".

Only top-level subdirectories of `/data/` are listed. Nested directories within those are accessible to the agent but are not listed separately in the directory picker.

## Verifying your mounts

To check that your directories are correctly mounted, you can exec into the running container:

```bash
docker compose exec zinchy ls /data/
```

You should see your mounted directories listed.
